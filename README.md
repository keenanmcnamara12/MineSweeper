# MineSweeper
Learning C++ and SFML by recreating the classic game.

# How to run (windows)
The simplest way to run is downloading the full source code. You can delete most of the things, but first we'll want to create a folder with the following structure:
--SomeFolder

---MineSweeperImages

----Cell1.png

----Cell2.png

----...

---Crashed Scoreboard.ttf

---MineSweeper.exe

The exe can now be run since it'll have access to necessary images and font.
